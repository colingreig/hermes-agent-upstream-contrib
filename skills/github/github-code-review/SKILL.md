# GitHub Code Review

Perform code reviews on local changes before pushing, or review open PRs on GitHub. Most of this skill uses plain `git` — the `gh`/`curl` split only matters for PR-level interactions.

## Prerequisites

- Authenticated with GitHub (see `github-auth` skill)
- Inside a git repository

### Setup (for PR interactions)

```bash
if command -v gh &>/dev/null && gh auth status &>/dev/null; then
  AUTH="gh"
else
  AUTH="git"
  if [ -z "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ]; then
    if _hermes_env="${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/.env"; [ -f "$_hermes_env" ] && grep -q "^GITHUB_TOKEN=" "$_hermes_env"; then
      GITHUB_TOKEN=$(grep "^GITHUB_TOKEN=" "$_hermes_env" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '\n\r')
    elif grep -q "github.com" ~/.git-credentials 2>/dev/null; then
      GITHUB_TOKEN=$(grep "github.com" ~/.git-credentials 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's|https://[^:]*:\([^@]*\)@.*|\1|')
    fi
  fi
fi

REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin)
OWNER_REPO=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed -E 's|.*github\.com[:/]||; s|\.git$||')
OWNER=$(echo "$OWNER_REPO" | cut -d/ -f1)
REPO=$(echo "$OWNER_REPO" | cut -d/ -f2)
```

## 1. Reviewing Local Changes (Pre-Push)

This is pure `git` — works everywhere, no API needed.

### Get the Diff

```bash
# Staged changes (what would be committed)
git diff --staged

# All changes vs main (what a PR would contain)
git diff main...HEAD

# File names only
git diff main...HEAD --name-only

# Stat summary (insertions/deletions per file)
git diff main...HEAD --stat
```

### Review Strategy

1. **Get the big picture first:**

```bash
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log main..HEAD --oneline
```

2. **Review file by file** — use `read_file` on changed files for full context, and the diff to see what changed:

```bash
git diff main...HEAD -- src/auth/login.py
```

3. **Check for common issues:**

```bash
# Debug statements, TODOs, console.logs left behind
git diff main...HEAD | grep -n "print(\|console\.log\|TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX\|debugger"

# Large files accidentally staged
git diff main...HEAD --stat | sort -t'|' -k2 -rn | head -10

# Secrets or credential patterns
git diff main...HEAD | grep -in "password\|secret\|api_key\|token.*=\|private_key"

# Merge conflict markers
git diff main...HEAD | grep -n "<<<<<<\|>>>>>>\|======="
```

4. **Present structured feedback** to the user.

### Review Output Format

When reviewing local changes, present findings in this structure:

```
## Code Review Summary

### Critical
- **src/auth.py:45** — SQL injection: user input passed directly to query.
  Suggestion: Use parameterized queries.

### Warnings
- **src/models/user.py:23** — Password stored in plaintext. Use bcrypt or argon2.
- **src/api/routes.py:112** — No rate limiting on login endpoint.

### Suggestions
- **src/utils/helpers.py:8** — Duplicates logic in `src/core/utils.py:34`. Consolidate.
- **tests/test_auth.py** — Missing edge case: expired token test.

### Looks Good
- Clean separation of concerns in the middleware layer
- Good test coverage for the happy path
```

---

## 2. Reviewing a Pull Request on GitHub

### View PR Details

**With gh:**

```bash
gh pr view 123
gh pr diff 123
gh pr diff 123 --name-only
```

**With git + curl:**

```bash
PR_NUMBER=123

# Get PR details
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
pr = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f\"Title: {pr['title']}\")
print(f\"Author: {pr['user']['login']}\")
print(f\"Branch: {pr['head']['ref']} -> {pr['base']['ref']}\")
print(f\"State: {pr['state']}\")
print(f\"Body:\n{pr['body']}\")"

# List changed files
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/files \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
for f in json.load(sys.stdin):
    print(f\"{f['status']:10} +{f['additions']:-4} -{f['deletions']:-4}  {f['filename']}\")"
```

### Check Out PR Locally for Full Review

This works with plain `git` — no `gh` needed:

```bash
# Fetch the PR branch and check it out
git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123
git checkout pr-123

# Now you can use read_file, search_files, run tests, etc.

# View diff against the base branch
git diff main...pr-123
```

**With gh (shortcut):**

```bash
gh pr checkout 123
```

### Leave Comments on a PR

**General PR comment — with gh:**

```bash
gh pr comment 123 --body "Overall looks good, a few suggestions below."
```

**General PR comment — with curl:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments \
  -d '{"body": "Overall looks good, a few suggestions below."}'
```

### Leave Inline Review Comments

**Single inline comment — with gh (via API):**

```bash
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view 123 --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')

gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/123/comments \
  --method POST \
  -f body="This could be simplified with a list comprehension." \
  -f path="src/auth/login.py" \
  -f commit_id="$HEAD_SHA" \
  -f line=45 \
  -f side="RIGHT"
```

**Single inline comment — with curl:**

```bash
# Get the head commit SHA
HEAD_SHA=$(curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['head']['sha'])")

curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments \
  -d "{
    \"body\": \"This could be simplified with a list comprehension.\",
    \"path\": \"src/auth/login.py\",
    \"commit_id\": \"$HEAD_SHA\",
    \"line\": 45,
    \"side\": \"RIGHT\"
  }"
```

### Submit a Formal Review (Approve / Request Changes)

**With gh:**

```bash
gh pr review 123 --approve --body "LGTM!"
gh pr review 123 --request-changes --body "See inline comments."
gh pr review 123 --comment --body "Some suggestions, nothing blocking."
```

**With curl — multi-comment review submitted atomically:**

```bash
HEAD_SHA=$(curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['head']['sha'])")

curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews \
  -d "{
    \"commit_id\": \"$HEAD_SHA\",
    \"event\": \"COMMENT\",
    \"body\": \"Code review from Hermes Agent\",
    \"comments\": [
      {\"path\": \"src/auth.py\", \"line\": 45, \"body\": \"Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.\"},
      {\"path\": \"src/models/user.py\", \"line\": 23, \"body\": \"Hash passwords with bcrypt before storing.\"},
      {\"path\": \"tests/test_auth.py\", \"line\": 1, \"body\": \"Add test for expired token edge case.\"}
    ]
  }"
```

Event values: `"APPROVE"`, `"REQUEST_CHANGES"`, `"COMMENT"`

The `line` field refers to the line number in the *new* version of the file. For deleted lines, use `"side": "LEFT"`.

## 3. Review Checklist

When performing a code review (local or PR), systematically check:

### Correctness
- Does the code do what it claims?
- Edge cases handled (empty inputs, nulls, large data, concurrent access)?
- Error paths handled gracefully?

### Security
- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or API keys
- Input validation on user-facing inputs
- No SQL injection, XSS, or path traversal
- Auth/authz checks where needed

### Code Quality
- Clear naming (variables, functions, classes)
- No unnecessary complexity or premature abstraction
- DRY — no duplicated logic that should be extracted
- Functions are focused (single responsibility)

### Testing
- New code paths tested?
- Happy path and error cases covered?
- Tests readable and maintainable?

### Performance
- No N+1 queries or unnecessary loops
- Appropriate caching where beneficial
- No blocking operations in async code paths

### Documentation
- Public APIs documented
- Non-obvious logic has comments explaining "why"
- README updated if behavior changed

## 4. Pre-Push Review Workflow

When the user asks you to "review the code" or "check before pushing":

1. `git diff main...HEAD --stat` — see scope of changes
2. `git diff main...HEAD` — read the full diff
3. For each changed file, use `read_file` if you need more context
4. Apply the checklist above
5. Present findings in the structured format (Critical / Warnings / Suggestions / Looks Good)
6. If critical issues found, offer to fix them before the user pushes

---

## 5. PR Review Workflow (End-to-End)

When the user asks you to "review PR #N", "look at this PR", or gives you a PR URL, follow this recipe:

### Step 1: Set up environment

```bash
source "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/skills/github/github-auth/scripts/gh-env.sh"
# Or run the inline setup block from the top of this skill
```

### Step 2: Gather PR context

Get the PR metadata, description, and list of changed files to understand scope before diving into code.

**With gh:**
```bash
gh pr view 123
gh pr diff 123 --name-only
gh pr checks 123
```

**With curl:**
```bash
PR_NUMBER=123

# PR details (title, author, description, branch)
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_OWNER/$GH_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER

# Changed files with line counts
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_OWNER/$GH_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/files
```

### Step 3: Check out the PR locally

This gives you full access to `read_file`, `search_files`, and the ability to run tests.

```bash
git fetch origin pull/$PR_NUMBER/head:pr-$PR_NUMBER
git checkout pr-$PR_NUMBER
```

### Step 4: Read the diff and understand changes

```bash
# Full diff against the base branch
git diff main...HEAD

# Or file-by-file for large PRs
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
# Then for each file:
git diff main...HEAD -- path/to/file.py
```

For each changed file, use `read_file` to see full context around the changes — diffs alone can miss issues visible only with surrounding code.

### Step 5: Run automated checks locally (if applicable)

```bash
# Run tests if there's a test suite
python -m pytest 2>&1 | tail -20
# or: npm test, cargo test, go test ./..., etc.

# Run linter if configured
ruff check . 2>&1 | head -30
# or: eslint, clippy, etc.
```

### Step 6: Apply the review checklist (Section 3)

Go through each category: Correctness, Security, Code Quality, Testing, Performance, Documentation.

### Step 7: Post the review to GitHub

Collect your findings and submit them as a formal review with inline comments.

**With gh:**
```bash
# If no issues — approve
gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --approve --body "Reviewed by Hermes Agent. Code looks clean — good test coverage, no security concerns."

# If issues found — request changes with inline comments
gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --request-changes --body "Found a few issues — see inline comments."
```

**With curl — atomic review with multiple inline comments:**
```bash
HEAD_SHA=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_OWNER/$GH_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['head']['sha'])")

# Build the review JSON — event is APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_OWNER/$GH_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews \
  -d "{
    \"commit_id\": \"$HEAD_SHA\",
    \"event\": \"REQUEST_CHANGES\",
    \"body\": \"## Hermes Agent Review\n\nFound 2 issues, 1 suggestion. See inline comments.\",
    \"comments\": [
      {\"path\": \"src/auth.py\", \"line\": 45, \"body\": \"🔴 **Critical:** User input passed directly to SQL query — use parameterized queries.\"},
      {\"path\": \"src/models.py\", \"line\": 23, \"body\": \"⚠️ **Warning:** Password stored without hashing.\"},
      {\"path\": \"src/utils.py\", \"line\": 8, \"body\": \"💡 **Suggestion:** This duplicates logic in core/utils.py:34.\"}
    ]
  }"
```

### Step 8: Also post a summary comment

In addition to inline comments, leave a top-level summary so the PR author gets the full picture at a glance. Use the review output format from `references/review-output-template.md`.

**With gh:**
```bash
gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Code Review Summary

**Verdict: Changes Requested** (2 issues, 1 suggestion)

### 🔴 Critical
- **src/auth.py:45** — SQL injection vulnerability

### ⚠️ Warnings
- **src/models.py:23** — Plaintext password storage

### 💡 Suggestions
- **src/utils.py:8** — Duplicated logic, consider consolidating

### ✅ Looks Good
- Clean API design
- Good error handling in the middleware layer

---
*Reviewed by Hermes Agent*
EOF
)"
```

### Step 9: Clean up

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D pr-$PR_NUMBER
```

### Decision: Approve vs Request Changes vs Comment

- **Approve** — no critical or warning-level issues, only minor suggestions or all clear
- **Request Changes** — any critical or warning-level issue that should be fixed before merge
- **Comment** — observations and suggestions, but nothing blocking (use when you're unsure or the PR is a draft)

## 6. Recovery / Stranded-Worktree PR Integrity Check — AUTOMATED, ENFORCED

**This is no longer just a manual checklist item — it is an automated, required CI gate that
structurally blocks merge.** The `pr-safety-gate` job (`.github/workflows/pr-safety-gate.yml`,
wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `all-checks-pass` required check) runs on every PR and
fails the check when it detects a recovery/stranded-worktree PR whose description doesn't match
its actual diff. A failing required check blocks merge via branch protection — a mismatched
recovery PR cannot sail through unnoticed the way the original incident's PR did.

The gate's logic lives in `hermes_cli/pr_safety_gate.py` (`check_recovery_pr` /
`is_recovery_pr`), which wraps the same `flag_recovery_pr_mismatch` heuristic
(`hermes_cli/content_gate.py`) described below, plus branch-name (`recover/*`, `recovery/*`,
`salvage/*`) and PR-title signal detection so recovery PRs are caught even when the description
itself doesn't use recovery wording. Unit tests: `tests/hermes_cli/test_pr_safety_gate.py`.

**What this means for you as a reviewer:** you no longer need to manually run this check to
prevent a merge — CI already will. This section is still useful for understanding *why* a PR got
blocked, for triaging a red `pr-safety-gate` check, and for the (now purely informational) manual
walkthrough below if you want to look at a recovery PR proactively before CI runs.

### Step 1: Detect recovery language

Read the PR description. If it contains phrases like "recovery", "stranded worktree",
"stranded-worktree", or "recovered branch" (case-insensitive), this check applies. Otherwise skip
straight to the normal review workflow above. (CI additionally checks the branch name and title —
see `is_recovery_pr` — so a PR can be in-scope even if the description itself is silent on it.)

### Step 2: Gather the claimed vs actual scope

```bash
# What the description claims (read it yourself — no command for this)
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json body --jq '.body'

# What actually changed
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER --stat
```

### Step 3: Compare

Either call the helper directly:

```python
from hermes_cli.content_gate import flag_recovery_pr_mismatch

warning = flag_recovery_pr_mismatch(pr_description, diff_stat_text)
```

or do the manual equivalent: list every file-path-looking token the description names (backtick-
quoted paths, or bare `dir/file.ext`-shaped tokens), and check each one actually appears in the
`--stat` output. Also compare file counts — if the description names only 1-2 files but the diff
touches 3x or more, the description understates the scope.

This is exactly what the `pr-safety-gate` CI job already does automatically on every PR — manual
review here is a proactive double-check, not the only line of defense.

### Step 4: If CI flags a mismatch, resolve it — do not bypass

A failing `pr-safety-gate` check is a **hard block**, not a suggestion. A legitimate recovery can
still touch more files than the description mentions (e.g. a lockfile regenerated as a side
effect) — that's a real mismatch by design, and it should be resolved by fixing the PR, not by
disabling or skipping the check:

1. Do **not** approve, merge, or bypass branch protection to force the merge through.
2. Read the failing check's log (`::error::` line) for the specific missing/extra files or the
   scope-understatement detail.
3. Update the PR description to accurately reflect the diff (or, if the diff itself is wrong,
   fix the diff) so the description and the actual changes line up.
4. Push the fix — CI re-runs automatically and the check should go green once they match.
5. If you genuinely believe the mismatch is a false positive (e.g. a regenerated lockfile), get
   explicit human confirmation before considering any manual override of branch protection —
   this should be rare, and the default path is always "fix the description or diff," not
   "override the gate."
