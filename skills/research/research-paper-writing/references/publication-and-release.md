# Publication and Release Deliverables

Use this reference after acceptance or when preparing code artifacts for submission. The main `SKILL.md` keeps the submission routing; this file preserves detailed branch-specific release examples and checklists.

## Research Code Packaging

Releasing clean, runnable code significantly increases citations and reviewer trust. Package code alongside the camera-ready submission.

**Repository structure:**

```
your-method/
  README.md              # Setup, usage, reproduction instructions
  requirements.txt       # Or environment.yml for conda
  setup.py               # For pip-installable packages
  LICENSE                # MIT or Apache 2.0 recommended for research
  configs/               # Experiment configurations
  src/                   # Core method implementation
  scripts/               # Training, evaluation, analysis scripts
    train.py
    evaluate.py
    reproduce_table1.sh  # One script per main result
  data/                  # Small data or download scripts
    download_data.sh
  results/               # Expected outputs for verification
```

**README template for research code:**

```markdown
# [Paper Title]

Official implementation of "[Paper Title]" (Venue Year).

## Setup
[Exact commands to set up environment]

## Reproduction
To reproduce Table 1: `bash scripts/reproduce_table1.sh`
To reproduce Figure 2: `python scripts/make_figure2.py`

## Citation
[BibTeX entry]
```

**Pre-release checklist:**
```
- [ ] Code runs from a clean clone (test on fresh machine or Docker)
- [ ] All dependencies pinned to specific versions
- [ ] No hardcoded absolute paths
- [ ] No API keys, credentials, or personal data in repo
- [ ] README covers setup, reproduction, and citation
- [ ] LICENSE file present (MIT or Apache 2.0 for max reuse)
- [ ] Results are reproducible within expected variance
- [ ] .gitignore excludes data files, checkpoints, logs
```

**Anonymous code for submission** (before acceptance):
```bash
# Use Anonymous GitHub for double-blind review
# https://anonymous.4open.science/
# Upload your repo → get an anonymous URL → put in paper
```

## Post-Acceptance Deliverables

**Goal**: Maximize the impact of your accepted paper through presentation materials and community engagement.

### Conference Poster

Most conferences require a poster session. Poster design principles:

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Size** | Check venue requirements (typically 24"x36" or A0 portrait/landscape) |
| **Content** | Title, authors, 1-sentence contribution, method figure, 2-3 key results, conclusion |
| **Flow** | Top-left to bottom-right (Z-pattern) or columnar |
| **Text** | Title readable at 3m, body at 1m. No full paragraphs — bullet points only. |
| **Figures** | Reuse paper figures at higher resolution. Enlarge key result. |

**Tools**: LaTeX (`beamerposter` package), PowerPoint/Keynote, Figma, Canva.

**Production**: Order 2+ weeks before the conference. Fabric posters are lighter for travel. Many conferences now support virtual/digital posters too.

### Conference Talk / Spotlight

If awarded an oral or spotlight presentation:

| Talk Type | Duration | Content |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Spotlight** | 5 min | Problem, approach, one key result. Rehearse to exactly 5 minutes. |
| **Oral** | 15-20 min | Full story: problem, approach, key results, ablations, limitations. |
| **Workshop talk** | 10-15 min | Adapt based on workshop audience — may need more background. |

**Slide design rules:**
- One idea per slide
- Minimize text — speak the details, don't project them
- Animate key figures to build understanding step-by-step
- Include a "takeaway" slide at the end (single sentence contribution)
- Prepare backup slides for anticipated questions

### Blog Post / Social Media

An accessible summary significantly increases impact:

- **Twitter/X thread**: 5-8 tweets. Lead with the result, not the method. Include Figure 1 and key result figure.
- **Blog post**: 800-1500 words. Written for ML practitioners, not reviewers. Skip formalism, emphasize intuition and practical implications.
- **Project page**: HTML page with abstract, figures, demo, code link, BibTeX. Use GitHub Pages.

**Timing**: Post within 1-2 days of paper appearing on proceedings or arXiv camera-ready.
